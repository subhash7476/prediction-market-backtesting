# PMXT Relay

`pmxt_relay/` is the VPS deployment subtree for the active PMXT mirror service.
Keep this folder limited to server infrastructure, service code, and deploy
artifacts. PC-side download helpers and other local workflows should live
outside `pmxt_relay/`.

Current direction:

- mirror raw PMXT archive hours onto disk
- optionally expose those mirrored raw files over `/v1/raw/*`
- keep the active relay scoped to raw mirroring and raw file serving

Older relay code has been archived under `archive/pmxt_relay_legacy/`.

## Active Commands

Mirror worker:

```bash
uv run python -m pmxt_relay worker
```

Mirror API:

```bash
uv run python -m pmxt_relay api
```

## Directory Layout

Default relay-owned state:

```text
/srv/pmxt-relay/
  raw/YYYY/MM/DD/polymarket_orderbook_YYYY-MM-DDTHH.parquet
  state/relay.sqlite3
  tmp/
```

The active relay only needs:

- `raw/` for mirrored PMXT hours
- `state/` for SQLite metadata
- `tmp/` for atomic download temp files

On startup the worker adopts any already mirrored local raw hours into the
state DB. During steady-state polling it only checks for incremental additions
instead of rescanning the full raw tree every cycle.

Repeated upstream 404s are no longer retried every poll forever. The active
relay now backs off failed mirrors and temporarily quarantines repeated 404s on
a slower retry cadence so one stale archive reference does not dominate every
worker cycle while the mirror still heals automatically when upstream recovers.

## Fresh Box Setup

On a fresh Ubuntu 24 box:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y git curl python3 python3-venv ufw fail2ban
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

git clone https://github.com/evan-kolberg/prediction-market-backtesting.git /opt/prediction-market-backtesting
cd /opt/prediction-market-backtesting

uv venv --python 3.12
uv pip install -e nautilus_pm/ bokeh plotly numpy py-clob-client duckdb textual

useradd --system --home /srv/pmxt-relay --shell /usr/sbin/nologin pmxtrelay || true
install -o pmxtrelay -g pmxtrelay -d /srv/pmxt-relay /srv/pmxt-relay/raw /srv/pmxt-relay/state /srv/pmxt-relay/tmp

cp pmxt_relay/systemd/pmxt-relay.env.example /etc/pmxt-relay.env
cp pmxt_relay/systemd/pmxt-relay-api.service /etc/systemd/system/
cp pmxt_relay/systemd/pmxt-relay-worker.service /etc/systemd/system/
cp pmxt_relay/systemd/pmxt-disable-wbt.service /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now pmxt-disable-wbt.service
systemctl enable --now pmxt-relay-api.service
systemctl enable --now pmxt-relay-worker.service
```

If you front the relay with Caddy, nginx, or another reverse proxy, serve
`/v1/raw/*` directly from `/srv/pmxt-relay/raw` when possible instead of
proxying large parquet downloads through Python.

Edit `/etc/pmxt-relay.env` before starting the services. The active relay does
not bake in archive or raw-origin URLs; set your mirror's upstream listing URL
and raw origin URL explicitly for the environment you run.

## API Surface

Active mirror-focused endpoints:

- `GET /healthz`
- `GET /v1/stats`
- `GET /v1/queue`
- `GET /v1/events?limit=100`
- `GET /v1/inflight`
- `GET /v1/system`
- `GET /v1/raw/{yyyy/mm/dd/filename}`
- mirror/system badge endpoints under `/v1/badge/*`

`/v1/stats`, `/v1/queue`, and the active badge routes only expose raw-mirror
state. The active relay path is limited to mirroring, health, and raw file
serving.

The public badges separate relay health from `r2.pmxt.dev` availability:

- `/v1/badge/status(.svg)` reports whether the relay itself is up, recent, and
  has active API/worker services.
- `/v1/badge/upstream(.svg)` reports whether `r2.pmxt.dev` is healthy,
  lagging, or erroring.

## Legacy Archive

Use `archive/pmxt_relay_legacy/` only if you need historical context for the
older relay implementation.
