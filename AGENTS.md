# Repository Notes For Agents

## Keep Scope Tight

- Treat subtree updates in `nautilus_pm/` as separate work. Do not mix an upstream subtree pull with normal bugfix/docs PRs.
- Keep repo-specific fixes in this repo layer unless there is a clear reason to update the vendored subtree.

## Local Verification

Run these before opening or merging a PR:

```bash
uv run ruff check --exclude nautilus_pm .
uv run ruff format --check --exclude nautilus_pm .
uv run pytest tests/ -q
```

Useful smoke checks:

```bash
uv run python backtests/kalshi_trade_tick/kalshi_breakout.py
uv run python backtests/polymarket_trade_tick/polymarket_vwap_reversion.py
uv run python backtests/polymarket_quote_tick/polymarket_pmxt_relay_ema_crossover.py
```

## What Matters Most

Optimize for real bugs, regressions, and stale operational assumptions, not
cosmetic churn.

High-value things to catch:

- broken direct runner entrypoints
- stale README/setup/deploy docs
- relay behavior that differs from what the docs claim
- multi-user/public relay fairness or stability issues
- event-loop blocking in API handlers
- memory growth that can accumulate forever
- timestamp / datetime warnings that pollute normal runs
- anything that would make public backtests slower, less reliable, or misleading

Lower-value things:

- minor wording nits with no operational consequence
- “strategy lost money” outcomes that are just normal backtest behavior
- unbounded PMXT local cache growth, which is intentional here

## Review / Issue Hunting

When asked to “look for issues,” prioritize:

1. public relay correctness and survivability
2. backtest runner correctness
3. docs/setup drift
4. organizational consistency

Things to explicitly check:

- Does `make backtest` still behave the way the repo expects?
- Do direct `uv run python path/to/script.py` runner paths still work?
- Do public relay endpoints return quickly and consistently?
- Do service names, env vars, and deploy paths in docs still match reality?
- Are there places where reverse proxies collapse client identity or headers?
- Are there stale buckets, temp files, or background artifacts that can grow forever?
- Are “warning-free normal runs” still true after the change?

When reviewing behavior, separate:

- real runtime/infrastructure bugs
- expected strategy outcomes such as negative PnL or `AccountBalanceNegative`

The latter is not automatically a code bug.

## End-To-End Claims

- If the user says `test everything`, `end-to-end`, `all backtests`, or asks whether `everything works`, verify the current worktree, not just `HEAD` or the PR diff.
- Do not claim `all backtests passed` until every runnable entrypoint under `backtests/` has returned `0` on the current tree.
- If the worktree is dirty, explicitly separate:
  - current-worktree verification
  - what is actually included in the PR/commit
- If the user reports a specific failing command, rerun that exact command first. Do not substitute a nearby script and call it equivalent.
- When touching PMXT loader behavior, runner bootstrap, `main.py`, or default backtest selection/parameters, verify both:
  - the direct script path for the affected runner
  - the interactive/menu path, e.g. `make backtest`
- Do not merge a backtest-affecting PR after only partial smokes if the user asked for full end-to-end validation.
- Clean up temporary sweep artifacts and long-running background verification processes before finishing.

## Backtest Runner Conventions

- Timing/progress output should stay enabled by default in `main.py`.
- `BACKTEST_ENABLE_TIMING=0` is the explicit quiet opt-out.
- Direct script runners must work both as package imports and as direct script execution via `uv run python path/to/script.py`.
- Use the shared `_script_helpers` bootstrap pattern for repo-root imports instead of one-off `sys.path` hacks.

## PMXT Cache

- Local PMXT filtered parquet cache is enabled by default.
- Treat unbounded local PMXT cache growth as intentional, not a bug to fix by default.

## Relay Facts

- Live checkout path: `/opt/prediction-market-backtesting`
- Relay env file: `/etc/pmxt-relay.env`
- Relay services:
  - `pmxt-relay-api.service`
  - `pmxt-relay-worker.service`
  - `pmxt-relay-prebuild.service`
- Public relay URL: `https://209-209-10-83.sslip.io`
- Trusted proxy env var: `PMXT_RELAY_TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS`

If relay code changes are deployed, verify both service state and HTTP health:

```bash
systemctl is-active pmxt-relay-api.service pmxt-relay-worker.service pmxt-relay-prebuild.service
curl -fsS https://209-209-10-83.sslip.io/healthz
curl -fsS https://209-209-10-83.sslip.io/v1/stats
curl -fsS https://209-209-10-83.sslip.io/v1/system
```

## Deploy Expectations

If a PR changes live relay behavior in `pmxt_relay/`, do not stop at local
tests if deploy access is available. Deploy and verify the real box.

Typical deploy steps:

```bash
rsync updated relay files to /opt/prediction-market-backtesting
update /etc/pmxt-relay.env if env semantics changed
systemctl restart pmxt-relay-api.service pmxt-relay-worker.service pmxt-relay-prebuild.service
systemctl is-active pmxt-relay-api.service pmxt-relay-worker.service pmxt-relay-prebuild.service
```

If restart is messy:

- check whether `prebuild` is stuck in shutdown
- verify the final state again after systemd settles
- do not assume “restart command returned” means the workers are healthy

After deploy, observe the relay for a few minutes instead of doing a single
spot check.

## Post-Deploy Observation

Sample for a few minutes:

- `/healthz`
- `/v1/stats`
- `/v1/system`
- `systemctl is-active ...`

What to watch for:

- repeated endpoint timeouts, not just one transient blip after restart
- services drifting from `active` to `inactive` / `deactivating`
- rising error counts in `/v1/stats`
- CPU staying pinned with API responsiveness degrading
- memory climbing without settling

One transient timeout immediately after restart is less important than a repeat.

## Relay Metrics Note

- `/v1/system` CPU is based on `1-minute loadavg / cpu_count`, capped at `100`.
- A high CPU percentage can reflect worker/prebuild pressure or I/O wait, not necessarily an API failure.
- Confirm with `uptime`, `/proc/loadavg`, `vmstat`, and top processes before concluding the box is unhealthy.

## Docs Invariants

- Root setup docs should include `duckdb`.
- Root README should describe PMXT cache as enabled by default.
- Root README and PMXT docs should describe timing output as default-on, with `BACKTEST_ENABLE_TIMING=0` as the opt-out.
- If relay behavior or env vars change, update both `pmxt_relay/README.md` and `pmxt_relay/systemd/pmxt-relay.env.example`.

Examples in README should be durable:

- prefer placeholders or bundled sample windows over fragile date-specific examples
- if an example is shown as a direct script path, confirm that exact invocation works

## PR Hygiene

- If the work belongs in the roadmap/known-issues history, add the relevant PR link in `README.md`.
- Review the PR diff after opening it, wait for GitHub Actions to pass, then merge.

## Testing Standard

Do not stop at unit tests if the change affects user-facing behavior.

Good default test mix for this repo:

- repo lint gate
- full pytest suite
- at least one direct-script backtest smoke
- at least one menu/default PMXT smoke when touching `main.py`, timing, or PMXT loader behavior
- live relay verification when touching deployed relay code
- full runnable `backtests/` sweep when the user explicitly asks for all backtests or when answering whether everything works end-to-end

If the user asks whether “everything works,” the answer should be based on:

- local tests
- representative smoke runs
- deploy verification if the live relay was touched

not just static code inspection.
