# Vendor Fetch Sources And Timing

## PMXT

When running a PMXT-backed quote-tick backtest, the loader fetches historical
L2 order-book data one hour at a time. In the current codebase, the hour lookup
order is:

1. local filtered cache
2. each explicit raw source in `DATA.sources`, left to right
3. none

`DATA.sources` is prefix-driven on purpose: use `local:`, `archive:`, and
`relay:` only. Bare hosts, bare paths, and alias prefixes are not accepted.

Two practical notes matter here:

- the shared public relay for this repository is mirror-first, so raw-hour
  serving is the supported shared-server path
- the public runner layer disables relay-hosted filtered parquet
- PMXT upstream raw hours live at flat object URLs like
  `https://r2.pmxt.dev/polymarket_orderbook_YYYY-MM-DDTHH.parquet`, while the
  local mirror serves those same files under dated `/v1/raw/YYYY/MM/DD/...`
  paths

After a successful fetch from a raw source, the result is written to the local
filtered cache so subsequent runs are fast.

## Example Output

The timing harness prints one completion line per resolved hour and keeps an
aggregate progress bar for any hours that are still in flight. A representative
`make backtest` PMXT run looks like this:

```text
make backtest
uv run python main.py

The important signals are:

- the `PMXT source:` line shows the exact cache, local, archive, and relay priority
  the runner will use
- each per-hour line shows the hour, load time, filtered row count, and the
  source that satisfied that hour
- `cache`, `local raw`, and `none` tell you whether the hour came from warm
  cache, the local raw mirror, or a confirmed miss
- `done` and `active` on the aggregate bar show how much of the window has
  completed and how many hours are still in flight
- the `prefetch:` segment shows the currently active raw-hour scans or
  transfers, including source, hour, bytes, and elapsed time

The exact timings, row counts, and active prefetch details vary with cache
warmth, mirror speed, and the requested window.

## Timing Expectations By Source

| Source | Typical time | When it happens |
|---|---|---|
| Local cache | <0.05s | Second run onward for the same market/token/hour |
| Local raw PMXT archive | local disk bound | You mirrored raw PMXT hours locally and pointed `DATA.sources` at `local:/...`, or used `PMXT_RAW_ROOT` for a lower-level loader workflow |
| Remote raw PMXT archive | network and file-size bound | Hour is missing from local cache and local raw mirror, so the client downloads the upstream raw parquet to a temp file and filters it locally |
| Relay raw mirror | network and file-size bound | A mirror-only relay serves `/v1/raw/...`, so the client downloads the raw parquet to a temp file and filters it locally |
| None | <1s | Hour does not exist yet |

## How To See This Output

Timing is enabled by default in the interactive menu and direct script runners
that use `@timing_harness`.

Turn it off explicitly with:

```bash
BACKTEST_ENABLE_TIMING=0 make backtest
```

Or run any PMXT runner directly:

```bash
uv run python backtests/polymarket_quote_tick_pmxt_ema_crossover.py
```

You can also time a runner explicitly through the harness test helper:

```bash
uv run python backtests/_shared/_timing_test.py backtests/polymarket_quote_tick_pmxt_ema_crossover.py
```

Public PMXT examples are pinned to known-good sample windows in code so the
direct script paths stay runnable without editing the file first. If your local
raw mirror or relay lives somewhere else, update `DATA.sources` in the runner
file.
