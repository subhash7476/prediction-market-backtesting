# Data Vendors, Local Mirrors, And Local Processing

This page is intentionally strict about what is supported today.

## PMXT

The repository direction is local-first:

- mirror raw hours onto local disk
- process those raw hours locally into the existing filtered cache layout
- treat server-side filtered relay processing as legacy

If you only need a shared mirror, keep the relay in raw mirror mode and serve
`/v1/raw/...` without server-side filtering.

Mirror deployment and archived self-hosted relay guidance live on the separate
[Mirror And Relay Ops](pmxt-relay.md) page so the vendor docs can stay focused
on data layout, source order, and local processing.

### Runner Source Modes

The preferred PMXT quote-tick path is runner-side source selection through
`MarketDataConfig(..., sources=...)`. Public runners now pin those source values
directly in code so the file is self-contained and directly runnable.

Example:

```python
DATA = MarketDataConfig(
    platform=Polymarket,
    data_type=QuoteTick,
    vendor=PMXT,
    sources=(
        "/data/pmxt/raw",
        "r2.pmxt.dev",
        "mirror.example.com",
    ),
)
```

With PMXT, the active public contract is:

1. local cache
2. local raw mirror
3. explicit remote PMXT archive
4. explicit raw mirror or relay fallback

After the cache layer, the runner honors the raw-source order exactly as you
list it in `DATA.sources`.

The underlying Nautilus PMXT loader still has a filtered-relay tier for people
running a legacy or self-hosted full-stack relay. In this repository's current
mirror-first setup, that filtered tier is not the shared-server path to rely on.

Legacy `PMXT_DATA_SOURCE` mode flags still work too:

Set `PMXT_DATA_SOURCE` to one of:

- `auto`
- `relay`
- `raw-remote`
- `raw-local`
- `filtered-local`

Examples:

```bash
PMXT_DATA_SOURCE=raw-remote \
uv run python backtests/polymarket_quote_tick_pmxt_ema_crossover.py
```

```bash
PMXT_DATA_SOURCE=raw-local \
PMXT_LOCAL_MIRROR_DIR=/data/pmxt/raw \
uv run python backtests/polymarket_quote_tick_pmxt_ema_crossover.py
```

```bash
PMXT_DATA_SOURCE=filtered-local \
PMXT_LOCAL_FILTERED_DIR=/data/pmxt/filtered \
uv run python backtests/polymarket_quote_tick_pmxt_ema_crossover.py
```

`raw-local` expects a local PMXT raw mirror. `filtered-local` is strict local
mode and will not fall back to the public relay or remote archive if an hour is
missing.

### Lower-Level Loader Env Vars

The public runner layer is pinned in code, but the underlying loader env vars
still work for custom integrations:

- `PMXT_LOCAL_ARCHIVE_DIR`
- `PMXT_RAW_ROOT`
- `PMXT_REMOTE_BASE_URL`
- `PMXT_RELAY_BASE_URL`
- `PMXT_CACHE_DIR`
- `PMXT_DISABLE_CACHE`

### What Works Today

The public PMXT runner layer reads one market/token/hour from these places:

1. local filtered cache
2. each explicit raw source in the order you list it in `DATA.sources`

The current "bring your own data" story is therefore:

- pre-populate the local PMXT filtered cache with PMXT-compatible market-hour
  parquet files
- or set `DATA.sources` in your runner to `("/path/to/raw-hours", "https://archive.example.com", "https://relay.example.com")`
- or point `PMXT_LOCAL_ARCHIVE_DIR` / `PMXT_RAW_ROOT` at a directory of raw
  PMXT hour files you already mirrored locally
- or use `PMXT_DATA_SOURCE=raw-local` with `PMXT_LOCAL_MIRROR_DIR`
- or run your own raw mirror and point `PMXT_RELAY_BASE_URL` at it

When the runner falls back to a remote raw source (`r2.pmxt.dev` or a relay
`/v1/raw/...`), it downloads that hour to a temporary local parquet file,
filters it locally, and deletes the temp artifact afterward. Persistent raw
disk growth only happens when you intentionally configure a local raw mirror.

The important distinction is:

- local raw mirrors and remote raw mirrors are the current first-class paths
- the public runner layer does not use relay-hosted filtered parquet
- filtered relay processing is legacy compatibility in the vendored PMXT loader,
  not the preferred shared deployment model for this repo
- if you want a team-facing processed-data service, that is now an explicitly
  self-hosted archive pattern rather than the active public relay path

If you want local-only PMXT replays, set both:

```bash
PMXT_RELAY_BASE_URL=0
PMXT_LOCAL_ARCHIVE_DIR=/path/to/pmxt-hours
```

The loader still does not expose a first-class runner flag for arbitrary vendor
raw dumps or automatic normalization from other vendors.

## Local Processing Command

To turn a local PMXT raw mirror into the same filtered market-hour parquet
layout used by the cache, run:

```bash
uv run python scripts/pmxt_process_local.py \
  --raw-root /data/pmxt/raw \
  --filtered-root ~/.cache/nautilus_trader/pmxt
```

Useful variant:

```bash
uv run python scripts/pmxt_process_local.py \
  --raw-root /data/pmxt/raw \
  --filtered-root /data/pmxt/filtered \
  --tmp-root /data/pmxt/tmp \
  --workers 4 \
  --start-hour 2026-03-01T00 \
  --end-hour 2026-03-07T23
```

The explicit `--vendor` flag is there so future local vendor adapters can plug
into the same entrypoint instead of adding more one-off PMXT-only scripts.

### Supported Local File Layout

When the loader reads from local filtered cache, it expects:

```text
<cache_root>/<condition_id>/<token_id>/polymarket_orderbook_YYYY-MM-DDTHH.parquet
```

Default cache root:

```text
~/.cache/nautilus_trader/pmxt
```

You can override it with:

```bash
PMXT_CACHE_DIR=/custom/path
```

Or disable it with:

```bash
PMXT_CACHE_DIR=0
PMXT_DISABLE_CACHE=1
```

For local raw PMXT archive hours, the loader accepts either of these layouts:

```text
<raw_root>/polymarket_orderbook_YYYY-MM-DDTHH.parquet
<raw_root>/YYYY/MM/DD/polymarket_orderbook_YYYY-MM-DDTHH.parquet
```

Enable that source with:

```bash
PMXT_LOCAL_ARCHIVE_DIR=/custom/raw-hours
```

The runner-level `raw-local` mode expects the archive-style layout:

```text
/data/pmxt/raw/YYYY/MM/DD/polymarket_orderbook_YYYY-MM-DDTHH.parquet
```

Enable that source with:

```bash
PMXT_DATA_SOURCE=raw-local
PMXT_LOCAL_MIRROR_DIR=/data/pmxt/raw
```

The runner-level `filtered-local` mode expects:

```text
/data/pmxt/filtered/<condition_id>/<token_id>/polymarket_orderbook_YYYY-MM-DDTHH.parquet
```

Enable that source with:

```bash
PMXT_DATA_SOURCE=filtered-local
PMXT_LOCAL_FILTERED_DIR=/data/pmxt/filtered
```

### Required Parquet Columns

Filtered cache parquet must contain exactly the columns the loader already
consumes:

- `update_type`
- `data`

`update_type` should be a string such as `book_snapshot` or `price_change`.

`data` should be a JSON string payload for one Polymarket L2 event.

Local raw PMXT archive parquet must contain:

- `market_id`
- `update_type`
- `data`

The loader filters raw hours to `market_id` at parquet scan time, then filters
the remaining rows to `token_id` inside the JSON payload.

### Required JSON Payload Shape

For `book_snapshot`, the loader decodes `data` with these fields:

```json
{
  "update_type": "book_snapshot",
  "market_id": "0x...",
  "token_id": "123...",
  "side": "buy",
  "best_bid": "0.45",
  "best_ask": "0.47",
  "timestamp": 1710000000.123,
  "bids": [["0.45", "100.0"]],
  "asks": [["0.47", "120.0"]]
}
```

For `price_change`, the loader decodes `data` with these fields:

```json
{
  "update_type": "price_change",
  "market_id": "0x...",
  "token_id": "123...",
  "side": "buy",
  "best_bid": "0.45",
  "best_ask": "0.47",
  "timestamp": 1710000001.456,
  "change_price": "0.46",
  "change_size": "25.0",
  "change_side": "buy"
}
```

The loader filters to `token_id` by regex-matching inside the `data` JSON, so
that field must be present and string-encoded exactly as expected.

## Relay Mode

The default relay is:

```text
https://209-209-10-83.sslip.io
```

Override it with:

```bash
PMXT_RELAY_BASE_URL=https://your-relay-host
```

Disable relay usage entirely with:

```bash
PMXT_RELAY_BASE_URL=0
```

Mirror-only deployments are the preferred server shape now. In that mode the
server keeps mirroring raw hours and may serve `/v1/raw/...`, but `/v1/filtered`
and filtered-hour listing endpoints are disabled or expected to miss.

## What Is Not Plug-And-Play Yet

- arbitrary third-party vendor raw formats
- automatic normalization from another vendor into the PMXT filtered shape

If you have your own global raw dumps today, the safe path is:

1. if they are already PMXT raw archive hours, point `PMXT_LOCAL_ARCHIVE_DIR`
   at them directly
2. otherwise convert them into the filtered market-hour parquet layout above
3. stage them into `PMXT_CACHE_DIR`
4. or add a new vendor adapter behind `uv run python scripts/pmxt_process_local.py`

That keeps the strategy and runner layer unchanged.
