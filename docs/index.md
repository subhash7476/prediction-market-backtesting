# Docs Index

This repository is documented around two active operating assumptions:

- vendor-backed historical data is local-first: mirror raw archive hours onto
  local disk, replay those raws directly, and keep shared infrastructure
  focused on raw mirroring and file serving
- public backtest runners are flat experiment specs built around `DATA`,
  `SIMS`, `STRATEGY_CONFIGS`, optional `EXECUTION` / `REPORT`, and a top-level
  `BACKTEST` object powered by `PredictionMarketBacktest`

PMXT is the first fully documented vendor path. Mirror and relay operations are
filed alongside the PMXT docs instead of being treated as a separate product
surface.
