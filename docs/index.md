# Docs Index

This repository is documented around two active operating assumptions:

- vendor-backed historical data is local-first: mirror raw archive hours onto
  local disk, process them locally, and keep shared infrastructure focused on
  raw mirroring and file serving
- public backtest runners are flat experiment specs built around `DATA`,
  `SIMS`, `STRATEGY_CONFIGS`, and a `PredictionMarketBacktest` object with a
  `.run()` entrypoint

PMXT is the first fully documented vendor path. Mirror and relay operations are
filed under the vendor/local-processing docs instead of being treated as a
top-level product surface.
